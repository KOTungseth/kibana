== {kib} 7.10.0

For detailed information about the 7.10.0 release, review the following information.

[float]
[[breaking-changes-7.10]]
=== Breaking changes

Breaking changes can prevent your application from optimal operation and performance. 
Before you upgrade to 7.10.0, review the breaking changes, then mitigate the impact to your application.

// The following section is re-used in the Installation and Upgrade Guide

// tag::notable-breaking-changes[]

[discrete]
[[breaking_kibana_legacy_plugins]]
==== Legacy plugins support removed

The legacy plugin system and the legacy plugin API have been removed.
Legacy plugin owners should migrate their plugins to the {kib} Platform plugin API.

*via https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/77599[#77599]*

[discrete]
[[breaking_kibana_plugins]]
==== Support added for Kibana Platform plugins

The `bin/kibana-plugin` CLI has been updated to work with the new {kib}
Platform plugin format instead of the legacy plugin format.

*via https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/74604[#74604]*

[discrete]
[[breaking_vega_visualizations]]
==== Vega visualizations without $schema property no longer supported

Previously, if you did not provide the $schema property,
the default value was set and hardcoded in the Vega code.
The visualization was then rendered with a warning message.
This introduced difficulties when updating the version of the Vega library.

Now all Vega specs must contain the $schema param. In no $schema
param exists, an error message is returned.
Refer to the https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/specification/[Vega docs] for
more information about this property.

*via https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/73805[#73805]*

[[deprecation-v7.10.0]]
=== Deprecations
Monitoring::

* These two config keys have been renamed and the old names will no longer work as of 8.0: cpu.cgroup.path.override => ops.cGroupOverrides.cpuPath and cpuacct.cgroup.path.override => ops.cGroupOverrides.cpuAcctPath {kibana-pull}76730[#76730]
Visualizations::
* In 7.0 and later, *Timelion* app is deprecated. In 8.0 and later, *Timelion* app is removed from {kib}. {kibana-pull}74660[#74660]
+
To prepare for the removal of *Timelion* app, you must migrate *Timelion* app worksheets to a dashboard.
+
NOTE: Only *Timelion* app is deprecated. {kib} continues to support *Timelion*
visualizations in *Dashboard*, *Visualize*, and *Canvas*.
+
To migrate a *Timelion* worksheet to a dashboard:

. Open the main menu, click *Dashboard*, then click *Create dashboard*.

. For each *Timelion* app worksheet, complete the following steps.

.. On the dashboard, click *Create New*, then click *Timelion* on the *New Visualization* window.

.. Open a new tab, open the *Timelion* app, select the chart you want to copy, then copy the chart expression.

* Navigational search UI metrics {kibana-pull}79238[#79238]
Operations::
* Kibana no longer needs to optimize plugins for use in the browser when a plugin is installed. This means the --optimize flag is now deprecated and does nothing now. It will be removed in 8.0 {kibana-pull}73154[#73154]
* Docker containers now use CentOS 8.2 as the base image, upgrading from 7. {kibana-pull}74656[#74656]
* Docker images now include CJK fonts built in {kibana-pull}74806[#74806]

* Adds Workplace Search side navigation {kibana-pull}74894[#74894]
* Adds support for version on create & bulkCreate when overwriting a document {kibana-pull}75172[#75172]
* Monitors the Task Manager Poller and automatically recovers from failure {kibana-pull}75420[#75420]
* Adds a new Enterprise Search overview plugin, which introduces and guides users to the App Search and Workplace Search plugins {kibana-pull}76734[#76734]
* The deprecated Dashboard Import API (POST /api/kibana/dashboards/import) now accepts filesizes up to the savedObjects.maxImportPayloadBytes configuration
which is 10MB by default {kibana-pull}77409[#77409]
Reporting::
* Reporting configuration settings for time duration values allow "time unit" strings to be specified as well as number of milliseconds.
For byte size values, "byte size" strings are allowed as well as number of bytes. See the Reporting configuration documentation for more details {kibana-pull}74202[#74202]
* Reporting/diagnostics {kibana-pull}74314[#74314]
* Removes the light gray border around the image in PDF reports {kibana-pull}78036[#78036]
* Increases capture.timeouts.openUrl to 1 minute {kibana-pull}75207[#75207]
Security::
* Hides management sections based on cluster/index privileges {kibana-pull}67791[#67791]
* xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey can now be rotated without losing access to existing encrypted Saved Objects (alerts, actions etc.).
Old key(s) can be moved to xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.keyRotation.decryptionOnlyKeys to be used only to decrypt existing objects while new or updated objects will be encrypted using new primary encryption key.
Administrators can also use dedicated API endpoint /api/encrypted_saved_objects/_rotate_key to trigger re-encryption of all existing objects with a new primary key so that old keys can be safely disposed {kibana-pull}72420[#72420]
* Groups features for space management {kibana-pull}74151[#74151]
* Allows passwords to be visible on security screens {kibana-pull}77394[#77394]
* Groups features for role management {kibana-pull}78152[#78152]

* Sharing saved-objects phase 1.5 {kibana-pull}75444[#75444]
* [Detections] Handle conflicts on alert status update {kibana-pull}75492[#75492]
* Improves the experience when Kibana returns a 403 HTTP status code or the user tries to access a page/app they do not have access to. In those instances, a new user-friendly error page is shown.
The user will get the option to go back to the page from where they came, or log in as a different user. Previously the user would just see a simple JSON document containing a short error message
without the ability to do anything {kibana-pull}75538[#75538]
* Adds EQL search strategy {kibana-pull}78645[#78645]
* Fetches related events from the server {kibana-pull}78780[#78780]
* [Resolver] Requests data from new event api {kibana-pull}78782[#78782]
* Updates copy styling {kibana-pull}79313[#79313]
* Excludes cloud alias index from our query {kibana-pull}81551[#81551]
* Implements server-side sessions. {kib} now stores user session information in a dedicated {es} index.
By default, expired and invalid sessions are cleaned from the index every hour.
You can configure the cleanup interval with the `xpack.security.session.cleanupInterval` setting.
After the upgrade, all existing sessions are invalid and users must log back in to {kib}.
It's also no longer possible
to host different {kib} tenants on different ports of the same host.
Although this setup worked in the past, it was discouraged because browsers
share cookies across all applications hosted using the same host name, ignoring ports.
Cookies are now strictly tied to a particular tenant. {kibana-pull}68117[#68117]

but they were still applied to the rendered output. In 7.10, these leftover queries and filters will be removed automatically from the saved object. In almost all cases, no change is necessary.
If a visualization contained these local queries and filters deliberately, they should be converted to panel filters in the "Panel options" of the TSVB interface {kibana-pull}75137[#75137]

Security::
* Displays useful error when role creation fails {kibana-pull}77600[#77600]
* Previously when user started SAML or OpenID authentication handshake, but didn't or couldn't finish it they weren't able to access Login Selector easily (e.g. to log in with another
authentication provider) unless they used /login URL directly or manually cleared the session cookies. That was a very confusing user experience.
The reason was that unauthenticated intermediate session that was created to support handshake forced Kibana to automatically restart the same handshake whenever user accessed Kibana.
We fixed that and now in certain cases we ignore unauthenticated intermediate session allowing user to easily access Login Selector whenever they need it {kibana-pull}79300[#79300]
