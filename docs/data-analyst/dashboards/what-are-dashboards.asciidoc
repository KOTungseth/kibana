= What are dashboards?

A _dashboard_ is a collection of visualizations, searches, and
maps, typically in real-time. Dashboards provide
at-a-glance insights into your data and enable you to drill down into details.

With *Dashboard*, you can:

* Add visualizations, saved searches, and maps for side-by-side analysis

* Arrange dashboard elements to display exactly how you want

* Customize time ranges to display only the data you want

* Inspect and edit dashboard elements to find out exactly what kind of data is displayed

If you see
the read-only icon in the application header,
then you don't have sufficient privileges to create and save dashboards. The buttons to create and edit
dashboards are not visible. For more information, see <<xpack-security-authorization>>.
