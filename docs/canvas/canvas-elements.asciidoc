Once you're ready to show off what you've created, use the presentation options in the upper left corner. These options control things such as data refresh intervals, display modes, and sharing capabilities.

In the top menu area, just above the page, there are a number of controls. On the left side of the top menu, you will find presentation-related features that control things such as data refresh intervals, display modes, and sharing capabilities. These will come in handy once you’re ready to show off your creation!

We'll talk more about how to import and export workpads in Sharing workpads, but keep in mind that you can import workpad JSON files by dragging them onto the Canvas home page. Maybe your data-loving friends have some that they care share!


TIP: To view your workpad in fullscreen mode, click the *Enter fullscreen mode* icon in the upper left corner.

No need to worry about cluttering up your space with too many workpads. The bulk editing actions allow you to clean up whenever you need.
