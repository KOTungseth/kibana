== Classic visualizations

Visualize includes several classic visualizations that allow you to plot, visualize, and analyze your aggregated Elasticsearch data.

Classic visualizations include:

* Line, area, bar, and pie charts
* Data table
* Metric
* Goal and gauge
* Tag cloud

=== Configure classic visualizations

You configure classic visualizations using the Visualize editor. Each visualization supports different metric and bucket configurations.

For example, a bar chart allows you to add an x-axis:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/add-bucket.png["",height=478]

A common configuration for the x-axis is to use the {es} {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-datehistogram-aggregation.html[date histogram aggregation]:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/visualize-date-histogram.png[]

To see your changes, click *Apply changes* image:images/apply-changes-button.png[]

If it's supported by the visualization, you can add more buckets. For example, when you add the
{es} {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html[terms aggregation] on the field
`geo.src`, the top five log traffic sources are displayed.

image::images/visualize-date-histogram-split-1.png[]

The new aggregation is added after the first aggregation, so the result displays
the top five log traffic sources for every three hours. To change the aggregation order, drag the aggregations into the order you want:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/visualize-drag-reorder.png["",width=366]

The visualization displays the top five overall log traffic sources, and compares them in three hour increments:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/visualize-date-histogram-split-2.png[]

For more information about the aggregations that Visualize supports, refer to <<supported-aggregations, Supported aggregations>>.

Each visualization also has its own customization options. Most visualizations allow you to customize the color of a specific series:
