=== Use rolled up data in a visualization

beta[]

Visualize your rolled up data in charts, tables, maps, and 
more. Most visualizations support rolled up data, with the exception of 
Timelion, TSVB, and Vega visualizations. 

You can match an index pattern to only rolled up data, or mix both rolled up 
and raw data to visualize all data together.  An index pattern can match only 
one rolled up index, not multiple. There is no restriction on the number of 
standard indices that an index pattern can match. When matching multiple 
indices, use a comma to separate the names, with no space after the comma. 

When you create a visualization from rolled up data:

* The data in a rollup index only has summarized metrics for specific fields. 
You are unable to search any other field from the original raw data. 
* Data is summarized into time buckets that might be split into sub buckets for 
numeric field values or terms. To lower granularity, ask for a time aggregation 
that takes several time buckets and combines them. For example, if the rollup 
job is aggregated by hours, ask for buckets of days.

Rolled up data shows the date histogram interval multiple and the limited 
metrics aggregations.

Dashboards can have a mixture of rollup visualizations and regular 
visualizations.

NOTE: Not all queries and filters support rollups.
