== Choose the data you want to display

Use the following data in your visualizations:

* <<index-patterns, Index pattern>> for the indices that contain the data you want to visualize
* Data from a <<save-open-search, saved search>>
* <<visualize-rollup-data, Rolled up data>>

=== Use rolled up data in a visualization

beta[]

Visualize your rolled up data in charts, tables, maps, and 
more. Most visualizations support rolled up data, with the exception of 
Timelion, TSVB, and Vega visualizations. 

To use rollup up data in your visualization, you must 
<<configure-rollup-index-pattern,create an index pattern for rollup up data>>.

When you create a visualization from rolled up data:

* The data in a rollup index only has summarized metrics for specific fields. 
You are unable to search any other field from the original raw data. 
* Data is summarized into time buckets that might be split into sub buckets for 
numeric field values or terms. To lower granularity, ask for a time aggregation 
that takes several time buckets and combines them. For example, if the rollup 
job is aggregated by hours, ask for buckets of days.

NOTE: Not all queries and filters support rollups.

Rolled up data shows the date histogram interval multiple and the limited 
metrics aggregations.
