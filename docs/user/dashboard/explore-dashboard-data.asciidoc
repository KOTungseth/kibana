[[search-in-dashboard]]
=== Search your data

Combine free text search with filtering based on structured data.
To search all fields, enter a simple string in the *Search* field. To search particular fields and
build more complex queries, use the <<kuery-query,Kibana Query language>>.
As you type, KQL prompts you with the fields you can search and the operators
you can use to build a structured query.

In the sample web logs data, display data only for the US:

. Enter `g`, and then select *geo.source*.
. Select *equals some value* and *US*, and then click *Update*.
. For a more complex search, try:
+
`geo.src : "US" and url.keyword : "https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/metricbeat"`
