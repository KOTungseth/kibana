[[aggregation-reference]]
== Aggregation reference

{kib} supports many types of {ref}/search-aggregations.html[{es} aggregations] that you can use to build complex summaries of your data. 

By using a series of {es} aggregations to extract and process your data, you can create panels that tell a 
story about the trends, patterns, and outliers in your data.
