== Enhance dashboards

Now that you have added panels to your dashboard, you can add filter panels to interact with the data, and Markdown panels to add context to the data. 
To make your dashboard look the way you want, use the editing options.

. From the toolbar, click *Edit*, then use the following options:

* To move, click and hold the panel header, then drag to the new location.

* To resize, click the resize control, then drag to the new dimensions.

[[add-controls]]
=== Add controls

To filter the data on your dashboard in real-time, add a *Controls* panel.

{kib} supports two types of *Controls*:

* *Options list* — Filters content based on one or more specified options. The dropdown menu is dynamically populated with the results of a terms aggregation. 
For example, use the options list on the sample flight dashboard when you want to filter the data by origin city and destination city.

* *Range slider* — Filters data within a specified range of numbers. The minimum and maximum values are dynamically populated with the results of a 
min and max aggregation. For example, use the range slider when you want to filter the sample flight dashboard by a specific average ticket price.

. From the dashboard, click *Create panel*.

. On the *New Visualization* window, click *Controls*.

. Click *Options*, then configure the following, then click *Update*:

* *Update {kib} filters on each change* &mdash; When selected, all interactive inputs create filters that refresh the dashboard. When unselected,
 {kib} filters are created only when you click *Apply changes*.

* *Use time filter* &mdash; When selected, the aggregations that generate the options list and time range are connected to the <<set-time-filter,time filter>>.

* *Pin filters for all applications* &mdash; When selected, all filters created by interacting with the inputs are automatically pinned.

*Markdown* is a text entry field that accepts GitHub-flavored Markdown text. For information about GitHub-flavored Markdown text, click *Help*.

. From the dashboard, click *Create panel*.

. On the *New Visualization* window, click *Text*.

. In the *Markdown* field, enter the text, then click *Update*.

For example, when you enter:

[[dashboard-customize-filter]]
=== Customize time ranges

You can specify the time range for each panel on the dashboard. For example, you configure a panel to display
the monthly trend for CPU usage, and a different to display the current CPU usage. Custom time ranges override the global <<set-time-filter,time filter>>.

. Open the panel menu, then select *More > Customize time range*.

. On the *Customize panel time range* window, specify the new time range, then click *Add to panel*.

[[clone-panels]]
=== Clone panels

To duplicate a panel and the configured functionality, clone the panel. Cloned panels continue to replicate all of the functionality from the original panel, 
including renaming, editing, and cloning. When you clone a panel, the clone appears beside the original panel, and moves other panels to provide a space on the 
dashboard.

. From the toolbar, click *Edit*. 

. Open the panel menu, then select *Clone panel*.
