**_Visualize your data with dashboards._**

The best way to understand your data is to visualize it. With dashboards, you can turn your data from one or more <<index-patterns, index patterns>> into a collection of panels 
that bring clarity to your data, tell a story about your data, and allow you to focus on only the data that's important to you. Configure each panel to display your data in a chart, table, map, and more, 
then compare the panels side-by-side to identify the patterns and connections in your data.

== Create dashboards

Dashboards provide you with the space where you add panels of your data.

[float]
=== Minimum requirements

To create dashboards, you must meet the minimum requirements. 

* If you need to set up {kib}, use https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service/signup?baymax=docs-body&elektra=docs[our free trial].

* Make sure you have {ref}/getting-started-index.html[data indexed into {es}] and an <<index-patterns,index pattern>>.

* Have an understanding of {ref}/documents-indices.html[{es} documents and indices].

* When the read-only indicator appears, you have insufficient privileges
to create or save dashboards. The options to create and save dashboards are not visible. For more information,
refer to <<xpack-security-authorization,Granting access to {kib}>>.

[float]
=== Open the dashboard

Begin with an empty dashboard, or open an existing dashboard. 

. Open the main menu, then click *Dashboard*.

. On the *Dashboards* page, choose one of the following options:

* To start with an empty dashboard, click *Create dashboard*.

* To open an existing dashboard, click the dashboard *Title*.

[float]
=== Create panels

Choose the type of panel you want to create, then save the panel to the dashboard.

. From the dashboard, choose one of the following options:

* To create a panel, click *Create panel*, then click the panel type on the *New visualization* window.

* To add a saved panel, click *Add from library*, then select the panel you want to add. When a panel contains a stored query, both queries are applied.

[[create-panels-with-lens]]
== Tutorial: Create a dashboard of panels with web server data

You collected data from your web server, and you want to visualize and analyze the data on a dashboard. To create dashboard panels of the data, open the *Lens* visualization builder, then  
create the visualization panels that best display the data.

[discrete]
[[add-the-sample-web-logs-data]]
=== Add the data and create the dashboard

To create visualizations of the data from the web server, add the data set, then create the dashboard.

. On the *Home* page, click *Try our sample data*.

. From *Sample web logs*, click *Add data*.

. Open the main menu, then click *Dashboard*.

. On the *Dashboards* page, click *Create dashboard*.

[float]
[[open-and-set-up-lens]]
=== Open and set up Lens

With *Lens*, you identify the data fields you want to visualize, drag and drop the fields, then watch as
*Lens* uses heuristics to apply the fields and create a visualization for you.

. From the dashboard, click *Create panel*.

. On the *New visualization* window, click *Lens*.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_end_to_end_1_1.png[New visualization popover]

. Make sure the *kibana_sample_data_logs* index appears.
+
The list of fields are dependent on the <<index-patterns,index pattern>>, <<set-time-filter,time filter>>, and field filters. 

[float]
=== View the data summaries

For each field, *Lens* shows a summary depending on the type of data. Date fields show the time distribution, string fields show the top 10 values, 
and numeric fields show a detailed summary with the top 10 values and a value distribution.

To view the data summary for a field, click *i* next to the field.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/lens_data_info.png[Data summary analyzed documents]

*Lens* uses a sample of 5,000 documents to perform the field analysis. The bottom line of the summary shows the percentage of sampled documents over all available documents.

When *Lens* presents the top 10 values distribution, it also shows the percentage of *Other* values. For array value fields, the percentage distribution considers each value in the array as separate.

[role="screenshot"]
