Dashboards are collections of panels that you configure and arrange to visualize and analyze your data. Each panel contains data from one or more index patterns, which allows 
you to create a complete overview of your data on a single dashboard. {kib} supports many types of panels that enable you to see your data from multiple perspectives.

== Create visualizations panels of your data

{kib} provides you with several ways to create visualization panels of your data. 

The quickest way to create visualization panels is to use the *Lens* visualization builder. With *Lens*, you add your data fields, then {kib} uses heuristics to apply each field 
and create the visualizations for you.

[[tsvb]]
If you'd like to  manually create visualization panels, you can use one of the <<add-panels-with-advanced-editors,advanced editors>> or 
<<add-aggregation-based-visualization-panels,aggregation-based options>>.

== Prerequisites

To build dashboards, you must meet the minimum criteria. 

* If you need to set up {kib}, use https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service/signup?baymax=docs-body&elektra=docs[our free trial].

* Make sure you have {ref}/getting-started-index.html[data indexed into {es}] and an <<index-patterns,index pattern>>.

* Have an understanding of {ref}/documents-indices.html[{es} documents and indices].

* When the read-only indicator appears, you have insufficient privileges
to create or save dashboards. The options to create and save dashboards are not visible. For more information,
refer to <<xpack-security-authorization,Granting access to {kib}>>.

[[create-panels-with-lens]]
== Create visualizations

Drag and drop the fields onto the visualization builder. The fields that appear are based on the selected 
<<index-patterns,index pattern>>, <<set-time-filter,time filter>>, and field filters.

. From the *Avialable fields* list, drag and drop the fields to the visualization builder. 
+
To preview a field, click *i* next to the field.

. To change the visualization type, use the following options:

* Click the *Suggestions*.

* Click the *Chart Type* dropdown, then select the visualization you want to use.
+
When there is an exclamation point (!) next to a visualization, {kib} is unable to transfer your data, but still allows you to change the visualization.

. To customize the data, click the fields in the editor, then change the options. The options available depend on the visualization type. 

. To add data from another index pattern, add a layer. 
+
Area, line, and bar charts support layers.

.. From the editor, click *+*.

.. Drag and drop the fields to the *Drop a field or click to add* fields.

.. From the *Change Index Pattern* dropdown, select the index pattern you want to add.
