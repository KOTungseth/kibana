**_Visualize your data with dashboards._**

The best way to understand your data is to visualize it. With dashboards, you can turn your data from one or more <<index-patterns, index patterns>> into a collection of panels 
that bring clarity to your data, tell a story about your data, and allow you to focus on only the data that's important to you. Configure each panel to display your data in a chart, table, map, and more, 
then compare the panels side-by-side to identify the patterns and connections in your data.

| Create beautiful displays of your geographical data.

| <<xpack-ml-anomalies,Anomaly swim lane>>
| Display the results from machine learning anomaly detection jobs.

| <<xpack-ml-anomalies,Anomaly chart>>
