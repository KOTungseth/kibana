**_Visualize your data with dashboards._**

The best way to understand your data is to visualize it. With dashboards, you can turn your data from one or more <<index-patterns, index patterns>> into a collection of panels 
that bring clarity to your data, tell a story about your data, and allow you to focus on only the data that's important to you. Configure each panel to display your data in a supported chart, table, map, and more, 
then compare the panels side-by-side to identify the patterns and connections in your data.

Dashboards support many types of panels, and several editors that you can use to create panels.

[cols="2"]
|===

| <<create-panels-with-lens,Lens>>
| The drag and drop editor that creates visualizations of your data. *Lens* is recommended for most users.

| <<maps,Maps>>
| Create beautiful displays of your geographical data.

| <<add-panels-with-advanced-editors,Advanced editors>>
| Visualize time series data with *TSVB* or *Timelion*. Build a fully custom visualization using *Vega* or *Vega-Lite*.

| <<add-aggregation-based-visualization-panels,Aggregation-based visualization panels>>
| Build most visualization types using {es} <<aggregation-reference,aggregations>>. 

| <<enhance-dashboards,Tools>>
| Add context to your panels with <<add-text,text>>, or add dynamic filters with <<add-controls,*Controls*>>.

| <<save-your-search,Saved search table>>
| Display a previously saved search table from <<discover, *Discover*>>. The table results are not aggregated.

| <<xpack-ml-anomalies,Machine Learning>>
| Display a previously saved visualization of <<xpack-ml, machine learning>> anomaly detection data.

[[create-the-dashboard]]
== Create dashboards

Dashboards provide you with the space where you add panels of your data.

[float]
=== Minimum requirements

To create dashboards, you must meet the minimum requirements. 

* If you need to set up {kib}, use https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service/signup?baymax=docs-body&elektra=docs[our free trial].

* Make sure you have {ref}/getting-started-index.html[data indexed into {es}] and an <<index-patterns,index pattern>>.

* Have an understanding of {ref}/documents-indices.html[{es} documents and indices].

* When the read-only indicator appears, you have insufficient privileges
to create or save dashboards. The options to create and save dashboards are not visible. For more information,
refer to <<xpack-security-authorization,Granting access to {kib}>>.

[float]
=== Open the dashboard

Begin with an empty dashboard, or open an existing dashboard. 

. Open the main menu, then click *Dashboard*.

. Choose one of the following options:

* To start with an empty dashboard, click *Create dashboard*.

* To open an existing dashboard, click the dashboard *Title* you want to open.

[float]
=== Create panels

Choose the type of panel you want to create, then save the panel to the dashboard.

. To create a panel, click *Create panel*, then click the panel type on the *New visualization* window.
+
To add a saved panel, click *Add from library*, then select the panel you want to add. When a panel contains a stored query, both queries are applied.

. To save the panel, click *Save* in the toolbar, then configure the *Save visualization* options.

.. Enter the *Title* and optional *Description*.

.. From the *Tags* drop down, select any applicable tags. 

.. Select *Add to Dashboard after saving*.

.. Click *Save and return*.

TIP: To access your saved panels, open the main menu, then click *Visualize*.

[float]
[[arrange-panels]]
[[moving-containers]]
[[resizing-containers]]
=== Arrange panels

To compare the data in the panels, arrange the panels on the dashboard, or remove the panel from the dashboard.

. From the toolbar, click *Edit*, then use the following options:

* To move, click and hold the panel header, then drag to the new location.

* To resize, click the resize control, then drag to the new dimensions.

* To delete, open the panel menu, then select *Delete from dashboard*.

. To save your changes, click *Save* in the toolbar.

[float]
[[search-in-dashboard]]
=== Search or filter your data

{kib} has a standard interface for applying {es} filters. These filters are combined with any panel-specific
filters to fetch the data you see.

[role="screenshot"]
image::dashboard/images/dashboard-filters.png[Labeled interface with semi-structured search, time filter, and additional filters]

Semi-structured search::
  Combines free text search with field-based search using the <<kuery-query,Kibana Query Language>>.
  Type a search term to match across all fields, or begin typing a field name to
  get prompted with field names and operators you can use to build a structured query.
  +
  For example, in the sample web logs data, this query displays data only for the US:

  . Enter `g`, and then select *geo.source*.
  . Select *equals some value* and *US*, and then click *Update*.
  . For a more complex search, try:

    `geo.src : "US" and url.keyword : "https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/metricbeat"`

Time filter::
  Dashboards have a global time filter which restricts the data shown, but individual panels can
  override the time range.
  The time range can be updated by dragging on a panel which shows time on the X axis.

  To override the time range for a specific panel:

  . Open the panel menu, then select *More > Customize time range*.

  . On the *Customize panel time range* window, specify the new time range, then click *Add to panel*.

[role="screenshot"]
image:images/time_range_per_panel.gif[Time range per dashboard panel]

Additional filters with AND::
  Individual filters can be added to a single dashboard or pinned to multiple pages in {kib}. Filters can be added using a simple editor or an advanced JSON editor for the {es} {ref}query-dsl.html[query DSL].
  +
  If more than one index pattern is shown on the dashboard, the filter editor will let you filter only one of them.
  +
  Filters can be dynamically added when you click a series in the dashboard.
  +
  For example, to filter the dashboard to display only ios data:

  . Click *Add filter*.
  . Set *Field* to *machine.os*, *Operator* to *is*, and *Value* to *ios*.
  . *Save* the filter.
  . To remove the filter, click *x* next to the filter.

Dynamic filters::
  The options above are present on all dashboard, but can be enhanced by adding a <<add-controls, *Control*>> to
  filter for a specific value of a field.

[float]
[[clone-panels]]
=== Clone panels

To duplicate a panel and the configured functionality, clone the panel. Cloned panels continue to replicate all of the functionality from the original panel, 
including renaming, editing, and cloning. When you clone a panel, the clone appears beside the original panel, and moves other panels to provide a space on the 
dashboard.

. From the toolbar, click *Edit*. 

. Open the panel menu, then select *Clone panel*. 
+
[role="screenshot"]
image:images/clone_panel.gif[clone panel]
+
{kib} automatically saves the cloned panel in *Visualize*. To access the cloned panel, open the main menu, then click *Visualize*.

[float]
[[explore-the-underlying-data]]
=== Explore the underlying documents

Dashboard panels have a shortcut to view the underlying documents in *Discover*. Open the panel menu,
then click *Explore underlying data*. *Discover* will be opened with the same time range and filters as the panel.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/explore_data_context_menu.png[Explore underlying data from panel context menu]

A second shortcut is disabled by default, and creates a new interaction when clicking on a chart.
This shortcut is similar to a <<drilldowns, drilldown>>, but can show you data for only one series.
To enable the chart interactivity shortcut, add the following to kibana.yml:

["source","yml"]
-----------
xpack.discoverEnhanced.actions.exploreDataInChart.enabled: true
-----------

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/explore_data_in_chart.png[Explore underlying data from chart]

TIP: *Explore underlying data* is available only for visualization panels with a single index pattern.

[float]
[[download-csv]]
=== Download panel data as CSV

Most panels can be individually downloaded as CSV, but there is a shortcut available
for *Lens* panels.

[role="xpack"]
Lens::
Open the *Lens* panel menu, then select *More > Download as CSV*.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/download_csv_context_menu.png[Download as CSV from panel context menu]

All panels::
  . Open the panel context menu and select *Inspect*.

  . Click *Download CSV*, then select the CSV type from the dropdown. The *Formatted CSV* contains
    human-readable dates and numbers, while the *Unformatted* option is for computer use.

[role="screenshot"]
image:images/Dashboard_inspect.png[Inspect in dashboard]

[float]
[[save-the-dashboard]]
=== Save the dashboard

When you're finished making changes, save the dashboard.

. From the toolbar, click *Save*.

. Enter the dashboard *Title* and an optional *Description*.

. From the *Tags* dropdown, select the tags you want to apply.

. To save the time range, select *Store time with dashboard*.

. Click *Save*.

[float]
[[share-the-dashboard]]
=== Share the dashboard

To share the dashboard with a larger audience, click *Share* in the toolbar, then choose one of the following options:

* *Embed code* &mdash; Embed the dashboard as an iframe in a web page. Embedded dashboards are fully interactive, but you can
  hide some parts of the dashboard using the options in the menu. User authentication is required, which can be provided by
  the end user or via reverse proxy.Â <<anonymous-authentication, Anonymous access>> is also supported. For more details,
  learn about <<kibana-authentication>>.

* *Permalinks* &mdash; Share a direct link to a {kib} dashboard. User authentication is required.

* *PDF Reports* &mdash; Generate a PDF report. For more information, refer to <<reporting-getting-started,Reporting>>.

* *PNG Reports* &mdash; Generate a PNG report. For more information, refer to <<reporting-getting-started,Reporting>>.

[float]
[[import-dashboards]]
=== Export the dashboard

Dashboards can be exported as JSON, which can be used to automate Kibana. The simplest way to do this is using
the <<dashboard-api>>. It is important to export dashboards with all references needed.
