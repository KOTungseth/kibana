**_Visualize your data with dashboards._**

The best way to understand your data is to visualize it. With dashboards, you can turn your data from one or more <<index-patterns, index patterns>> into a collection of panels 
that bring clarity to your data, tell a story about your data, and allow you to focus on only the data that's important to you.

Panels display your data in charts, tables, maps, and more, which allow you to compare your data side-by-side to identify patterns and connections. Dashboards support several editors you can use to create panels, and support many types of panels to display your data.

[cols="2"]
|===

| <<create-panels-with-editors,Editors>>
| Use the *Lens*, *TSVB*, *Vega*, and *Timelion* editors to create visualizations of your data, or create *Aggregation based* visualizations using {es} aggregations. 
*Lens* is the recommended editor.

| <<maps,Maps>>
| Create beautiful displays of your geographical data.

| <<xpack-ml-anomalies,Anomaly swim lane>>
| Display the results from machine learning anomaly detection jobs.

| <<xpack-ml-anomalies,Anomaly chart>>
| Display an anomaly chart from the *Anomaly Explorer.

| <<logs-app,Log stream>>
| Display a table of live streaming logs.

| <<enhance-dashboards,Tools>>
| Add context to your panels with <<add-text,text>>, or add dynamic filters with <<add-controls,*Controls*>>.

| <<save-your-search,Saved search from Discover>>
| Display a saved search data table from <<discover, *Discover*>>. The table results are not aggregated.
