For each field, *Lens* shows a summary depending on the type of data. Date fields show the time distribution, string fields show the top 10 values, 
and numeric fields show a detailed summary with the top 10 values and a value distribution.

To view the data summary for a field, click *i* next to the field.

*Lens* uses a sample of 5,000 documents to perform the field analysis. The bottom line of the summary shows the percentage of sampled documents over all available documents.

When *Lens* presents the top 10 values distribution, it also shows the percentage of *Other* values. For array value fields, the percentage distribution considers each value in the array as separate.

NOTE: The sum of all the *Other* fields can equal more than 100% by a small amount.
