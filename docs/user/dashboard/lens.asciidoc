==== View the data summaries

For each field, *Lens* shows a summary depending on the type of data. Date fields show the time distribution, string fields show the top 10 values, 
and numeric fields show a detailed summary with the top 10 values and a value distribution.

To view the data summary for a field, click *i* next to the field.

*Lens* uses a sample of 5,000 documents to perform the field analysis. The bottom line of the summary shows the percentage of sampled documents over all available documents.

When *Lens* presents the top 10 values distribution, it also shows the percentage of *Other* values. For array value fields, the percentage distribution considers each value in the array as separate.

NOTE: The sum of all the *Other* fields can equal more than 100% by a small amount.

For specific information about *Lens* visualization, review to the frequently asked questions.

[[can-i-show-value-labels-for-my-chart]]
===== Can I show value labels for my chart?

At the moment only a subset of *Lens* visualization allows to show value labels:

* `Bar` / `Horizontal Bar` charts.

*Note*: Date histograms cannot show value labels even when a Bar chart is used.

* `Pie` / `Donut` / `Treemap` charts (enabled by default)

[float]
[[can-i-sort-by-multiple-columns]]
===== Can I sort by multiple columns?

Multiple column sorting is unsupported in *Lens*, but is supported in *Discover*. For information on how to sort multiple columns in *Discover*, 
refer to <<explore-fields-in-your-data,Explore the fields in your data>>.

[float]
[[how-are-ip-address-sorted]]
===== How are IP addresses sorted?

The *Lens* data table sorts IP addresses in IPv4 and IPv6 formats.
For both formats, each block of IP addresses are compared and sorted, therefore it becomes easier to find addresses within the same subnet:

image::images/lens_ipv4_sorting.png[Lens datatable with IPv4 sorted field]

When IP addresses of both formats are found as field content, then IPv4 addresses are mapped into IPv6-mapped addresses, and sorted as IPv6 addresses.

NOTE: `Other` is always at the bottom of the sorting, no matter the direction.
