Visualize enables you to create visualizations of the data from your Elasticsearch indices, which you can then add to dashboards for analysis.

{kib} visualizations are based on Elasticsearch queries. By using a series of {es} {ref}/search-aggregations.html[aggregations] to extract and process your data, you can create charts that show you the trends, spikes, and dips you need to know about.

To start creating visualizations, click *Visualize* in the side navigation.

With *Visualize*, you can:

* Choose from a variety of visualizations to display your data

* Choose from a set of aggregations to extract and process your data

* Change the display options to best display your data
