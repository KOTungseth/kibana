With *Visualize*, you can create visualizations of the data in your {es} indices, which you can then add to <<dashboard,dashboards>> and <<canvas,Canvas>> for analysis.

{kib} visualizations are based on {es} queries. By using a series of {es} {ref}/search-aggregations.html[aggregations] to extract and process your data, you can create 
visualizations that show you the trends, spikes, and dips you need to know about.

To begin, open the menu, then click *Visualize* from the *Kibana* menu. On the *Visualizations* page, click *Create visualization*.

== Choose your visualization tool

{kib} provides you with many tools to help you visualize your {es} data. Whether you have a lot of experience creating visualizations, or none at all, {kib} has a tool for you.

[cols="2*<"]
|===

| <<lens,*Lens*>>

  | Want to quickly create a visualization? Start with Lens, where you drag and drop data fields to get an immediate view of your data. 

| <<most-frequent,*Classic visualizations*>>

  | Stick with the classics to visualize your Elasticsearch data, including charts, progress monitors, heat map, and more.

| <<TSVB,*TSVB*>>

 | Display and compare your time series data by combining an infinite number of data aggregations with TSVB visualizations, including metric, Top N, gauge, markdown, and table. 
With TSVB, you can analylze multiple index patterns and customize every aspect of your visualization. 

| <<timelion,*Timelion*>>

 | Create two-dimensional graphs with your time series data using Timelion, which is driven by a simple expression language you use to retrieve data, perform calculations, and visualize the results.

| <<maps,*Elastic Maps*>>

 | Parse through your location-based data to create maps with multiple layers and data sources, map individual geo points and shapes, and use dynamic client-side styling.

| <<heat-map,*Heap map*>>

| Create visualizations of your categorical data, where the inidividual values are represented by colors. 

| <<for-dashboard, *Dashboard tools*>>

 | Build tools that enable you to interact with the visualizations on your dashboards in real time.

| <<vega-graph,*Vega*>>

 | Create fully customizable visualizations with multiple data sources that are available from the Vega library.

[[choose-your-data]]
== Choose your data

There are three types of data you can use in your visualizations.

*New search criteria.* Use an <<index-patterns, index pattern>> for the indices that
contain the data you want to visualize.

*Saved search.* Use a <<save-open-search,saved search>> from Discover. When you create a visualization from a saved search, any changes made to the saved search are reflected in the
visualization. To disable automatic updates, <<managing-saved-objects,delete the visualization>>.

*Rolled up data.* Use an index pattern that includes <<rollup-index-pattern,rolled up data>>.
Rolled up data is summarized into
time buckets that splits into sub buckets for numeric field values or
terms.

[float]
[[vis-inspector]]
== Inspect visualizations

Many visualizations allow you to inspect the query and data behind the visualization.

. From the {kib} toolbar, click *Inspect*.
. To download the data, click *Download CSV*, then choose one of the following options:
* *Formatted CSV* - Downloads the data in table format.
* *Raw CSV* - Downloads the data as provided.
. To view the requests for collecting data, select *Requests* from the *View*
dropdown.

[float]
[[save-visualize]]
== Save visualizations
To use your visualizations in <<dashboard, dashboards>> and <<canvas,Canvas>>, you must save them.

. From the {kib} toolbar, click *Save*.
. Enter the visualization *Title* and optional *Description*, then *Save* the visualization.

To access the saved visualization, go to *Management > {kib} > Saved Objects*.

[[save-visualization-read-only-access]]
=== Read only access
When you have insufficient privileges to save visualizations, the following indicator is
displayed and the *Save* button is not visible.

For more information, refer to <<xpack-security-authorization>>.

[[visualize-share-options]]
== Share visualizations

When you've finished your visualization, you can share it outside of {kib}.

From the *Share* menu, you can:

* Embed the code in a web page. Users must have {kib} access
to view an embedded visualization.
* Share a direct link to a {kib} visualization.
* Generate a PDF report.
* Generate a PNG report.
