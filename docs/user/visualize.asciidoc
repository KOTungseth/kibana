_Visualize_ enables you to create visualizations of the data from your {es} indices, which you can then add to <<dashboards,dashboard>> for analysis.

{kib} visualizations are based on {es} queries. By using a series of {es} {ref}/search-aggregations.html[aggregations] to extract and process your data, you can create visualizations that show you the trends, spikes, and dips you need to know about.

With *Visualize*, you can:

* Simply drag and drop data fields into Lens to get an immediate view of your data. Use the smart suggestions to see new ways of visualizing your data. Quickly switch between chart types and index patterns.

* Classic chart.

* TSVB.

* Timelion.

* Maps.

* Dashboard tools.

* Vega.


To begin, open *Visualize*, then click *Create new visualization*.

[[choose-your-data]]
== Choose your data

Before you create a visualization, you need to choose the data you want to visualize. There are three data options that you can use.

*New search criteria.* Use an <<index-patterns, index pattern>> for the indices that
contain the data you want to visualize. If you're not ready to use your own data, use a <<add-sample-data, sample data set>>, which has a pre-built index pattern.

*Saved search.* Use a <<save-open-search,saved search>> from Discover. When you create a visualization from a saved search, any changes made to the saved search are reflected in the
visualization. To disable automatic updates, delete the visualization
on the <<managing-saved-objects,*Saved Objects* UI>>.

*Rolled up data.* Use an index pattern that includes <<rollup-index-pattern,rolled up data>>.
Rolled up data is summarized into
time buckets that splits into sub buckets for numeric field values or
terms. To lower granularity, use a time aggregation that uses and combines

[[vis-inspector]]
== Inspect visualizations

Many visualizations allow you to inspect the query and data behind the visualization.

. From the {kib} toolbar, click *Inspect*.
. To download the data, click *Download CSV*, then choose one of the following options:
* *Formatted CSV* - Downloads the data in table format.
* *Raw CSV* - Downloads the data as provided.
. To view the requests for collecting data, select *Requests* from the *View*
dropdown.

[[save-visualize]]
== Save visualizations
To use your visualizations in <<dashboard, dashboards>>, you must save them.

. From the {kib} toolbar, click *Save*.
. Enter the visualization *Title* and optional *Description*, then *Save* the visualization.

To access the saved visualization, go to *Management > {kib} > Saved Objects*.

[[visualize-share-options]]
== Share visualizations

When you've finished your visualization, you can share it outside of {kib}.

From the *Share* menu, you can:

* Embed the code in a web page. Users must have {kib} access
to view an embedded visualization.
* Share a direct link to a {kib} visualization.
* Generate a PDF report.
* Generate a PNG report.
