To help external systems track job statuses, the reporting APIs use HTTP response codes to provide feedback.

`200` (OK)::
    Indicates successful requests to queue or download reports.
    
NOTE: {kib} sends a `200` response status for successfully queuing a Reporting job via
the POST URL. This is true even if the job somehow fails later, since report
generation happens asynchronously from queuing.

`400` (Bad request):: 
    Indicates that the request failed to use `POST` as the HTTP method, or include the `kbn-xsrf` header.

`503` (Service unavailable):: 
    When you use the `path` to request the download, indicates that the report is generating. The
    response includes a `Retry-After` header. You can set the script to wait the
    number of seconds in the `Retry-After` header, then repeat until the report is complete.

`500` (Internal server error)::
    When using the `path` to request the download, indicates that the report is unavailable due to an error when
    generating the report. To view information about the error, open the main menu, then click *Reporting*.
