To automatically generate reports from a script, make a request to the `POST` URL.
The response from the request is JSON, and contains a `path` property with a
URL to use to download the generated report. Use the `GET` method in the HTTP request to
download the report.

For example, to queue CSV report generation using the `POST` URL with cURL:

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
---------------------------------------------------------
curl \
-XPOST \ <1>
-u elastic \ <2>
-H 'kbn-xsrf: true' \ <3>
'http://0.0.0.0:5601/api/reporting/generate/csv?jobParams=...' <4>
---------------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE

<1> The required `POST` method.
<2> The user credentials for a user with permissions to access {kib} and the {report-features}.
<3> The required `kbn-xsrf` header. For more information, refer to <<api-request-headers, API Request Headers>>.
<4> The POST URL.

A successfully queued report response includes the following:

[source,json]
---------------------------------------------------------
{
  "path": "/api/reporting/jobs/download/jxzaofkc0ykpf4062305t068", <1>
  "job": {
    "id": "jxzaofkc0ykpf4062305t068",
    "index": ".reporting-2018.11.11",
    "jobtype": "csv",
    "created_by": "elastic",
    "payload": ..., <2>
    "timeout": 120000,
    "max_attempts": 3
  }
}
---------------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE

<1> The relative path on the {kib} host for downloading the report.
<2> (Not included in the example) Internal representation of the reporting job, as found in the `.reporting-*` index.
