[[reporting-layout-sizing]]
=== Change the layout and size

The layout and size of the PDF or PNG images depend on the {kib} app.
When you generate *Canvas* reports, the workpad dimensions determine the size of the report. 
When you generate *Discover*, *Dashboard*, and *Visualize Library* reports, the table, panel, and visualization dimensions determine the size of the report.
To change the layout and size of the report, change the size of your browser, which resizes the shareable container. {kib} captures the shareable container when you click
*Generate* or *Copy POST URL*.

[[add-workpad-website]]
== Share on a website

beta[] *Canvas* allows you to create _shareables_, which are workpads that you download and securely share on any website.
