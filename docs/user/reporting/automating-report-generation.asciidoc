To automatically generate PDF and CSV reports, generate a POST URL, then submit the HTTP `POST` request using {watcher} or a script.

=== Create a POST URL

Create the POST URL that triggers a report to generate PDF and CSV reports.

To create the POST URL for PDF reports:

. Open the main menu, then click *Dashboard, *Visualize Library*, or *Canvas*.

. Open theÂ dashboard, visualization, or **Canvas** workpad you want to share.

. From the toolbar, click *Share > PDF Reports*, then choose an option:

* If you are using *Dashboard* or *Visulize Library*, click *Copy POST URL*.

* If you are using *Canvas*, click *Advanced options > Copy POST URL*.

To create the POST URL for CSV reports:

. Open the main menu, then click *Discover*.

. Open the saved search you want to share.

. In the toolbar, click *Share > CSV Reports > Copy POST URL*.

=== Deprecated report URLs

The following POST URL paths are deprecated.

* Dashboard reports:  `/api/reporting/generate/dashboard/<dashboard-id>`
* Visualize reports:  `/api/reporting/generate/visualization/<visualization-id>`
* Saved Search reports: `/api/reporting/generate/search/<saved-search-id>`

If there are problems using the paths after you upgrade {kib}, regenerate the POST URL for the report.

[IMPORTANT]
===================
In previous {kib} versions, generation URLs included a `&sync` parameter that held requests open until documents finished generating. The `&sync` parameter has been removed.
If you use the `&sync` parameter, such as in Watcher, you must update the generation URLs.
